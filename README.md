# Endocytic motif distributions

This repository contains data used to analyze the distribution of motifs in ordered and disordered regions of proteins. 
The hypothesis is that previously unrecognized proteins can be identified by analyzing the distribution of endocytic motifs in the disordered and ordered regions of proteins across the human proteome.
Proteins enriched for these motifs in their disordered regions will be targeted for further experimental testing as they may be functionally important in endocytosis. 

The "markdown_files" folder contains the main R script, a markdown script and html, and the plots produced from the script. 

The "shiny_app" folder contains the script for a shiny app that shows the distribution plot for each endocytic motif as selected by user. 

The "poster_files" folder contains a poster depicting the research done for the Rowan University Student Scholars Symposium 2019, as well as the supporting diagrams used within the poster.
